//This is an alertspammer by Quadrants on Github, not to be used to attack anybody, this is simply a test that I'm probably not gonna touch/update for a while.
//Enjoy messing around with this thingy, I might update it but it's not very likely I will. This is pretty useless if the user whos on this page is using a decent web browser, just for your info.
